    FeynDiagram is a library of C++ routines which allow you to draw
high quality PostScript Feynman diagrams by writing a short C++ program
to describe the diagram (ie. where the vertices and lines go).  Knowledge
of C++ is not necessary, but a C++ compiler is.
    Tutorial-style documentation (with lots of examples of output from
FeynDiagram) is in the form of a compressed PostScript file Docs/tutorial.ps.Z,
which can be sent directly to a PostScript printer after uncompress'ing.
    See README_installnotes and README_compilernotes for information
about installing FeynDiagram.
