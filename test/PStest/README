author: harald

1) need to setup subdirectories 
   in PStest directory, 
   e.g. PStest/Z2

2) need to provide Run.dat files in
   directories: PStest/Z2/Run.dat

3) generate PSpoints and collectPS.log with
   qsub submit.sh
   need to adapt "list1" in get_PSdata.sh in order 
   to avoid complete regeneration

4) generate targets: ./get_targets.sh
